The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Illumination s best since Despicable Me 1  Granted  this  is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers  But given the fact that these makers were tasked with making a  that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations  they did a pretty good job  In fact  a slightly better job than I was expecting  The voice cast was the subject of much controversy  and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot on  A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion  but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters  Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences  and some of them were quite thrilling  This is easily Illumination s most visually stunning   and a massive step up from every one of their other s since the first Despicable Me  As for the plot  it s just the plot of every Mario game  And for the most part  that s all it needs to be  Every beat plays out almost exactly like you d expect it to  with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there  The messiest parts of the   if I m going to get critical  are the dialogue  which is often quite stupid  and the characters  They just try to deal with too many of them  and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires  almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff  and even when there is a payoff  it s haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending  Although I think 85 90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated  normally  this one could ve benefitted from an extra 10 20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more  We move so quickly from location to location that there s never any time to breathe or get invested  But that s my adult perspective  I had a pretty breezy  fun  and heartwarming time  though I would ve liked more meat on the script  My theater was PACKED  and probably 75  young children  and they all seemed to have the time of their lives  Your kids will probably love it  and you will probably more than tolerate it ,0.3333333333333332,0.2093971631205674
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,An absolute BLAST  First off this  is for kids and fans of Nintendo and the Mario franchise  I still think an adult who isnt a fan could still enjoy it but this  is so full of fan service that it will have you smiling the whole time  The voice acting I was skeptical but they all work and work well too  Jack Black is the star here  I love how they kept the story simple like all of the games  Truly felt like a video game on screen  This  felt like a beautifully animated amusement park ride  The audio in the  was amazing too  The sounds and the score with reimagined iconic music was perfect  Some of the songs in the  felt unnecessary but they worked  I think they should ve bumped the run time to 105 120 min  90 min felt too short as it goes by quick  I havent had this much wholesome fun at the s in a long time  If youre a fan you HAVE to see it ,1.0,0.19393939393939397
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Chris Pratt was awesome as Mario and Jack black as bowser was remarkable       After meeting Chris Pratt at the Santa Barbara  festival I m very amazed of how remarkable Chris played Mario for the first  I remember playing Mario kart double dash on GameCube 20 years ago with my sister during Christmas Day and I absolutely loved the game   Universal and Nintendo did a great job making this  for kids and adults who played the video game since the 80s 90s 2000s to now   The Mario  was absolutely awesome and very creative from the video game   Chris was absolutely hilarious as Mario   Jack black as bowser was the best for the   His voice was a mixture of Vader which I find so outstanding  Chris who voiced Mario did a fantastic job  He used the characters voice very carefully  The sounds were just like the video game  And i think that was absolutely awesome  The story taking place in New York to the mushroom kingdom is brilliant  Princess peach was the best part of the    She had a good way of showing bowser she will not marry a turtle   And toad was the best part of the    The rest of the characters including donkey Kong voiced by Seth rogen was so awesome  I hope in the next Mario  yoshi finds Mario and Luigi and becomes they re pet ,1.0,0.4057676767676768
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Everyone is so fixated on rotten tomatoes scores  it really is a solid  I am someone who is not swayed by  critics  or rotten tomato scores  I didn t even really have any expectations going into this   As someone who grew up playing Super Mario Bros  Super Mario World etc   I was really just going to see this  based on nostalgia and it does deliver on nostalgia  The visuals are stunning  and while everyone has their reservations about Chris Pratt the voice acting is perfect  except one for one elderly character   While many have said this  moves quickly or  too fast   I would say it has great pacing and never leaves you bored  While it is not a perfect  it leaves little to be desired  It is everything you want from an animated Super Mario Movie ,0.5555555555555556,0.22161458333333336
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Brilliant animation and portrayal of the super Mario bros  Took my kids for a special sky screening and boy were we excited  At first I was rather skeptical thinking this  won t do any justice to the games  However  I was wrong  This  met our expectation and beyond  I think I enjoyed this  more than my kids  From the moment the  starts it is enjoyable  Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes  A lot of laughable moments  Apart from the  being too short it still met my expectations  As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood  this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games  A must watch  whether you have kids or not ,1.0,0.22596726190476188
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Critics are being too harsh for what it is I think for what this  sets out to do  Super Mario Bros  Movie pretty much ticks the boxes of an entertaining  reference fan service heavy   A lot of the jokes are basic sure  but it s just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie  Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go  Not high art or anything  but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least  Voice acting wasn t as bad as I thought  and Jack Black was the highlight as expected  Yeah  not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is  and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it s one of the best ones easily if you ask me ,0.3333333333333332,0.16020833333333337
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,pretty much as expected Mario  Chris Pratt  and Luigi  Charlie Day  are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers  When the city s sewer goes haywire  Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame  Instead  they get sucked into an alternate world  The brothers get separated  Mario joins Princess Peach  Anya Taylor Joy  to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser  Jack Black   Luigi gets captured  It s brightly colored  It s energetic  It s got the characters  There s the game play  The story is fairly simple  It s pretty much what I expected  I wish there is more heart to it  The brothers could have been that  but they get separated pretty quickly  I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans  It s got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids  It s less so for everybody else ,0.1111111111111111,0.17105263157894737
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,The Message Of Love Is Sent Directly To The Fanbase  Not To The General Audience  This is a  that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there  even if they don t necessarily play Mario anymore  The  delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the   including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises  The  is packed with non stop action and fast paced storytelling  leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see  It may not be able to fulfill every fan s wishes  but it s understandable and sets up for a sequel  as there is a post credits scene  But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough  this might be a  that is difficult to understand  There may be questions like why does it have to be like this  Why do it this way  Why is the world so strange  This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is  Even though the story is simple and has nothing much  But if you don t think too much  it s an easy and enjoyable  to watch  with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me ,0.3333333333333332,0.14766666666666667

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Movie not took take seriously Some people are taking this  too seriously  This  is just supposed to be fun and colorful and not to be taken like a tarantino  or something  Of course the plot could be improved a bit here and there but it s actually a really fun and entertaining  when you just enjoy the ride  If you re a big fan of Mario you will absolutely love this  100   I felt like a little kid again when i saw all the characters and easter eggs in every scene  The animation was insanely well done and i believe they could ve made the  a bit longer to expand on the world a bit more and get to know each character more but that s about it ,0.5555555555555556,0.11121794871794871
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,Don t listen to the critics on rotten tomatoes  this  is really good  As a Mario fan myself it was a very enjoyable and fun action packed   While watching I just couldn t wipe the smile off my face  Jack black did an amazing job with voice acting bowser  Everyone did a great job and while I do agree Chris Pratt could have been better i got use to it really quick and im sure pretty much everyone else will too and besides  the Italian accent in the games is great but definitely not meant for a 80 minute   The plot is very simple which is good however because a Mario story shouldn t be complex at all and the people at illumination definitely know how the games should be  Speaking of that  you can tell the people behind this  put a lot of heart into it  Definitely give this a strong recommendation if you like Mario or have childhood memories with Mario in any way or just wanna watch an enjoyable family  ,0.7777777777777777,0.272
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,So much fun This  is so much damn fun and I absolutely loved everything about it  The composing in this  is some of the best I ve ever heard and it fit so well in the   The voice acting was pretty good too and I didn t think Chris Pratt would be any good as Mario but he was actually pretty good but Jack Black stole the show as Bowser as he absolutely killed his role  Charlie Day was great too as Luigi as he was probably my 2nd favorite in the   The only problem I have with this  is it felt so quick and I wish it was longer and it s only 90 minutes  Other than that this  is just a ton of fun and worth the watch ,0.5555555555555556,0.31485507246376804
